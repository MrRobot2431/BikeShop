		<p id="p1">One of our most popular mountain bikes is the Trek Marlin 4. It is the perfect bike for trail riding. It is also very ideal for new riders who want a mountain bike with knobby tires that can double as a rugged commuter. Disc brakes, front suspension, 21 speeds, and mounts for a rack and fenders make this a great bike for new trail riders and campus commuters alike. <strong>Buy now for $499! Or rent for $45 for half a day or $90 for full day! </strong></p><!-- description of Trek Marlin 4 bike -->
		<p id="p1">Another very popular bike here at Miller's Bicycles is the Santa Cruz Tallboy C R Complete Mountain Bike. The Santa Cruz Bicycles Tallboy C R Complete Mountain Bike is a stunning example of just how great bikes have become. The heart of this model is the C-carbon frame, with its updated geometry and ability to ride way out of its perceived short-travel suspension limitations. The Tallboy offeres many riders their first glimpse of a future where 29 inch wheels and full suspension could coexist with amazing handling. <strong>Buy now for $399!
